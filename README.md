## üéØ The Problem

Managing personal savings is hard, but managing *group savings* is even harder. Whether it's for a vacation, a shared goal, or a traditional savings circle (like a *susu* or *chit fund*), groups rely on messy spreadsheets, constant reminders, and social pressure. This process is prone to errors, missed payments, and a lack of transparency, often leading to failed goals and frustration.

## üí° The Solution: KOSH

**KOSH** is a FinTech web application that digitizes and automates this entire process. It provides a secure, transparent, and motivating platform for both **individual** and **collaborative savings**.

By enforcing rules, automating contributions, and applying penalties for missed payments, KOSH transforms a chaotic social process into a simple, disciplined financial tool, helping users build healthy financial habits and achieve their goals together.



## ‚ú® Key Features

### üë• Group Savings (The Core)
* **Create & Join Groups:** Form public (auto-join) or private (admin approval) savings groups.
* **Group Campaigns:** Set shared savings goals with start/end dates and contribution amounts.
* **Contribution Tracking & Penalties** Tracks manual monthly contributions and automatically applies a penalty (up to 40%) for late/missed payments to enforce discipline.
* **Admin-Triggered Payouts:** After the campaign ends, the admin distributes the funds with a single click, triggering an equal and automated payout to all members.

### üë§ Individual & Wallet System
* **Individual Savings:** Create personal, private savings goals (with manual contributions) to track your own progress.
* **Personal Wallet:** Securely manage your funds, top-up your balance, and track all transaction history.
* **Secure Authentication:** Full login/register system with email verification (using NextAuth & JWT).
* **User Profiles:** Update personal details and manage your account.

### üõ°Ô∏è Smart Rules & Platform
* **Admin Controls:** Group admins manage members, approve requests, and oversee campaigns.
* **Spam Prevention:** Limits group joining requests to prevent system abuse.
* **Safe Deletion Logic:** Admins must distribute funds and delete their group *before* they can delete their own account, ensuring no one loses their money.
* **Dashboard:** A central hub to view your wallet, active campaigns, and group progress.
